		Initialize MT_response object to track mouse movements and collect

                    experiment: The current experiment instance. 
                        In an OpenSesame script, this is usually the self.experiment
                        variable.
                    buttons: Either a list of button names corresponding to the names
                        of the button rect elements that were added to the canvas object
                        (that is passed on to the canvas argument).
                        Or a dictionary defining the response buttons
                        (if no canvas object is passed on). 
                        Each key corresponds to the name that will be returned by the
                        _exec method if the user responds using the button (either by
                        clicking it or by moving the cursor into the associated area).
                        Each value contains four integers that define the button area:
                        The left  x- and top  y-coordinate and the width and height of
                        the button (as used in the canvas.rect function).
                    canvas: An optional canvas object that contains the screen
                        with the response buttons specified as named elements.
