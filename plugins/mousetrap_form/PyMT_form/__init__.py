    	Executes the MT_form object to display the form, collect responses, and

	    Args:
	        logging_resolution (int): Time interval (in ms) between recordings 
				of the mouse position.
			timeout (int): Response timeout (in ms). Use None (default) if there
				is no timeout.
			reset_mouse (bool): Reset mouse position when tracking starts.
			start_coordinates (tuple): The x- and y- coordinates the cursor
				should be reset to.
			start_unit (str): The unit used to define the start coordinates. 
				By default ("grid"), it corresponds to the form grid units, and
				the mouse cursor is reset to the left upper corner of the
				specified grid position (if a float is given, linear
				interpolation is performed). An alternative that also uses the
				form grid unit is "widget", whereby the mouse cursor is reset to
				the center of the widget for which starting coordinates are
				provided (if no widget has the start coordinates for this
				position, the mouse is centered on the position of the grid).
				Finally, "pixel" can be used to specify the start coordinates in
				pixel metric (in sketchpad metric).
			click_required (bool): Click required to indicate response. If False, 
				a response can be indicated just by entering the area of one 
				of the buttons with the mouse.
			mouse_buttons_allowed (list): The (physical) mouse buttons that 
				can be used to click one of the buttons.
			track_clicks (bool): Enable separate tracking of mouse clicks. 
				If True, the physical mouse button that was clicked will be 
				returned along with a corresponding timestamp as a separate 
				list.
			max_initiation_time (int): If specified, a custom warning message 
				will be displayed if no mouse movement was initiated after the 
				specified time limit (in ms).
			warning_widget (list): Custom widget that is displayed if the
				initiation time is exceeded. A list containing all the arguments
				required by the form.set_widget function.
	    
		Returns:
			resp (str): The text of the buttton that was clicked.
			resp_time (int): Response time (in ms).
			initiation_time (int): Time (in ms) until a movement was initiated.
			timestamps (list): Timestamps (in ms) for each recorded position.
			xpos (list): x-positions for each recorded position.
			ypos (list): y-positions for each recorded position.
			clicks (list): (Physical) mouse button for each mouse click. 
				Only returned if track_clicks is True.
			clicks_timestamps (list): Timestamp (in ms) for each mouse click. 
				Only returned if track_clicks is True.
